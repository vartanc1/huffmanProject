A Huffman tree, also known as a Huffman coding tree, is a specific type of binary tree that is used in data compression algorithms, particularly in Huffman coding. It is named after David A. Huffman, who developed the algorithm in 1952.

Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for lossless data compression. The main idea behind Huffman coding is to assign shorter binary codes to more frequent symbols and longer binary codes to less frequent symbols, optimizing the encoding of a message to minimize the total number of bits used. --ChatGPT
